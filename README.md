## Learning Objectives

- **Lecture 24: NoSQL Introduction**, students will be able to:
  - Explain how & why NoSQL databases emerged to address modern data challenges
  - Compare major NoSQL data models
    - Document (e.g. MongoDB)
    - Key-Value (e.g. Redis)
    - Wide-column (e.g. Cassandra)
    - Graph (e.g. Neo4j)
  - Acknowledge the use case of NoSQL data models in bioscience
  
- **Lecture 25: Mongodb Hands-on**, students will be able to:
  - Explain RBAC model on MongoDB
  - Understand MongoDB CRUD operations:
    - Create
    - Read
    - Update
    - Delete
  - Explore the provided dataset schema with python
  - Perform queries to the provided dataset with python
  - Explain how aggregation works

- **Lecture 26: Mongodb Hands-on**, students will be able to:
  - Understand the fundamental data model
    - Nodes
    - Relations
    - Properties

- **Lecture 27: Mongodb Hands-on**, students will be able to:
  - Model the genomic data as a graph
  - Build genomic graph database with Neo4j
  - Perform Biological insights via graph querying
    - Identify similar genomics based on shared KOs annotations
    - Infer evolutionary patterns of KOs across a phylogenetic structure


### Pre-requisites
- Basic Python Skills
  - Understand python data structures (list, dict, set, tuple)
  - Can write simple functions to manipulate data
  - Familiar with Python syntax and control flow (if, for, while)
- Basic SQL Skills
  - Undderstand SQL database concepts (tables, rows, columns)
  - Can write simple SQL queries to manipulate data

### Course Description

This two-day intensive course offers a specialized exploration of NoSQL databases, emphasizing their role in bioinformatics and data science. Participants will investigate key architectures and use cases of NoSQL systems—including document stores (MongoDB/JSON) and graph databases—to manage and analyze complex biological datasets, such as genomic sequences, pangenomic structures, and molecular interaction networks.


## Run with Github Codespace

Github Codespaces provides a cloud-based environment that is consistent, reproducible, and easy to use for audiences. 

Setting up the codespace from scratch might be slow, we have prebuilt available when a change on `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` is made on `main` branch.
